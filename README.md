# LEC Lamellipodia Analysis

This is a Python Jupyter notebook for detecting lamellipodia from segmented larval epithelial cell (LEC) images.

## Description

A full description of the theory, aims and methods behind this computational image analysis approach is described in the Joint Dissertation - "_Characterising the induction and regulation of migratory behaviour in_ Drosophila _larval epithelial cells_".

This notebook includes the following sections:
- Importing packages
- Defining functions
  - Process Cellpose segmentations (from LEC Analysis code)
  - Finding cell edges
  - Detecting lamellipodia
  - Lamellipodia analysis
- Code usage
  - Processing Cellpose segmentations
  - Visual Analysis
    - Frame 0-102 (Panels for figures)
  - Quantitative Analysis
